An individual’s annual income results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.  This is a widely cited KNN dataset. It is a good starter example for data pre-processing and machine learning practices.

In this project, we will discuss:
- How to fetch random samples from the Dataset?
- isin
- between
- unique
- dropna
- replace
- duplicated
- drop_duplicates
- astype
- apply
- What is Univariate analysis?
- What is Bivariate analysis?
- Memory Optimization
